# admin-page-guesser
This program fetches for admin login directory/page in a certain website


Using this program you can find hidden directories in a website 


There is also a .exe file for people who do not know how to use .py file.. Just download the exe file and click on it and the program will start.


- It's better to use VPN before you start the program.
- You can use the program without a text file for paths! just enter the website link and boom!
- You can find other hidden pages too! not only admin login page.
